# 👋 Hey, I'm Kartik Anagawadi

🚀 **Machine Learning Engineer** | 🧠 **AI/ML Explorer**

---

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with close to 2 years of experience, currently working remotely at a startup. My focus is on building deep learning pipelines for **image classification**, **object detection**, and **real-time inference** using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

My work includes building models for **fish freshness classification**, optimizing inference using **OpenVINO**, and developing internal tools for **dataset annotation** and **multimodal search**. I enjoy learning by doing and frequently explore areas like **multimodal AI**, **transformers**, and **model deployment**.

## 🧰 What I’ve Worked On

- 🐟 Built CNN-based models for **fish freshness prediction** with up to 90% accuracy on real-world images.
- ⚡ Optimized deep learning inference using **Intel OpenVINO**, achieving 4x speedups on Intel hardware.
- 📦 Developed tools for **object segmentation and YOLOv8 dataset export** to accelerate dataset creation.
- 🔍 Implemented a **multimodal search engine** using CLIP and FAISS for text-to-image and image-to-image retrieval.
- ☁️ Deployed ML models using **FastAPI** and **Django REST APIs**, integrated with **AWS EC2, S3, and RDS**.
